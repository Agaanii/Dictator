// Tracks pending buildings which the user is trying to place (ghost)
// Places the buildings when the user chooses to do so (placement)
// Applies progress to buildings currently in progress (construction)

// During Action phase advances the construction of buildings, 
//	and creates any ghosts or placements as needed
// During Render phase, updates any building visuals as needed
// During the cleanup phase, checks any buildings that have health to see if they need to die
